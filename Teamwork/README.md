This document
describes the **teamwork assignment **for
the **End-To-End JavaScript Applications**
course at Telerik Academy.

## Project Description

Design and implement an
**End-To-End JavaScript application**.
It can be a discussion forum, blog system, e-commerce site, online gaming site,

### Public Part

The **public part** of your projects should be **visible****without authentication**. This public part could be the application
start page, the user login and user registration forms, as well as the public
data of the users, e.g. the blog posts in a blog system, the public offers in a
bid system, the products in an e-commerce system, etc.

### Private Part (User Area)

**Registered users** should have personal area in the Web
application accessible after **successful
login**. This area could hold for example the user's profiles management
functionality, the user's offers in a bid system, the user's posts in a blog
system, the user's photos in a photo sharing system, the user's contacts in a
social network, etc.

### Administration Part

**System administrators** should have administrative access to the
system and permissions to administer all major information objects in the
system, e.g. to create / edit / delete users and other administrators, to edit

system, to edit / delete posts in a blogging system, edit / delete products and
categories in an e-commerce system, etc.
